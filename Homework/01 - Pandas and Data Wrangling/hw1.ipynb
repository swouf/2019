    "The data you'll be working with comes from multiple sources. The main data source will be [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/), a database of publications from major computer science journals and conferences. A subset of DBLP, which you will use in this assignment, is provided to you via a [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kci8joML74tCSzuBbhxtd1ylR4f0dlm6/view). Later on, you will enrich the DBLP data with a dataset on conference rankings and with the proceedings of the [NIPS conference](https://nips.cc/) [1] ('proceedings' is another word for the set of papers published at an academic conference). After loading and cleaning the data, you will answer various questions about its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some rules:**\n",
    "- You are allowed to use any built-in Python library that comes with Anaconda. If you want to use an external library, you have to justify your choice.\n",
    "- Make sure you use the data folder provided in the repository in *read-only* mode.\n",
    "- Be sure to provide explanations for your answers. A notebook that only has code cells will not suffice.\n",
    "- Also, be sure to *hand in a fully-run and evaluated notebook*. We will not run your notebook for you, we will grade it as is, which means that only the results contained in your evaluated code cells will be considered, and we will not see the results in unevaluated code cells. In order to check whether everything looks as intended, you can check the rendered notebook on the GitHub website once you have pushed your solution there.\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] Note that NIPS was renamed to NeurIPS in 2018, but for simplicity, whenever we say 'NIPS', we really mean 'NIPS and NeurIPS'."

Real-world data is usually messy, with typos, erroneous entries, and sometimes issues that make even loading the data problematic. Fix any errors that you encounter along the way, find ways to clean the attribute `year`, and redo the plot of the number of papers per year.   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Machine learning (ML) has been one of the hottest topics within the broader area of AI recently, so let’s see if this is reflected in the number of ML publications. In particular, let’s focus on the two major ML conferences, NIPS and ICML: make a new dataframe with only NIPS and ICML papers (let’s call these the “ML papers”), plot the number of ML papers over time, and analyze and discuss the plot. Do you observe anything odd in this plot? What causes these problems?   \n",

Complete the paper-centric dataframe by scraping the full NIPS data from the online proceedings at https://papers.nips.cc/ (maintain the same schema used in your previous dataframes, but fill in missing values). After this step, remove any remaining papers that have missing values. Redo the plots of steps A3.2 and A3.3 after fixing the issue.   \n",

Calculate a *'new'* author ranking (give each author a score, by which the authors are then sorted in order to obtain the ranking), where each author's score is the sum of the H5-indices of all their papers (the H5-index of a paper being the H5-index of the conference it is published in).\n",
    "3. Analyze your new, H5-index-based author ranking and explain how and why your results are different from the previous ranking. Do you see any differences in the top-20 authors based on the H5-index-based ranking and the one produced using publication counts? If yes, list the authors that are ranked in the top 20 based on publication counts but absent in the top 20 based on the H5-index-based ranking. Identify the ranks of these authors in the ranking produced by the H5-index based ranking scheme.\n",
    "4. Now, take the authors in the file `data/list_of_selected_authors.txt`, and compute their rankings using the two (naïve and H5-index-based) ranking schemes. What do you observe? Explain the potential dangers of the naïve, paper-count-based score.\n",
